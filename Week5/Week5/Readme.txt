In this website I have sweet alert plugin fronm
this http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/ link where i download 
the css and JS files of sweet alert. I have used sweet for the
 text fields at the buttom of this websites where if enter numbers in the 
name textfield. it will pop up box an error same feature for the phone field.
In addition if everything is correct and you click the submit button it gonna show a popup box with success message. Plus it also clears the field if you invalid entries in the fields.
